LOLWUT - League of Legends Web Uber Tracker
===========================================

RTMP client implementation for the League of Legends stream data written for easy web consumption.

The idea is to build an HTML5 compliant RTMP client that knows how to communicate with the Riot game servers for whichever regions / servers you want.  Once completed, we'll migrate the data into an event store for Complex Event Processing.  From there, we can create an API into the event stream for consumption by other clients and frameworks.

All of this could eventually be hosted in the cloud somewhere.  For great justice.
